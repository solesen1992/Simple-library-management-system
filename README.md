# Simple library management system
This project provides a console library management system written in C#. It includes functionality for managing a collection of books, such as adding new books, displaying books, searching for books by title, updating book details, removing books, and saving/loading the book collection to/from a file.

This exercise was made to help me understand basic C# concepts and get comfortable with the language's syntax and object-oriented programming.
